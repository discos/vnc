This repository contains the scripts used to connect to the DISCOS VNC
graphical sessions on the three INAF single-dish radio telescopes.
The scripts are provided for both `bash` (for Unix-like operating systems) and
`PowerShell` (Microsoft Windows).
The documentation also guides you through the setup process for the scripts and
their dependencies.
